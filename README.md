## 3. Description: 
Internet retail, also known as **e-commerce**, is the largest sector of the electronics industry, generating an estimated $29 trillion in 2019. E-commerce platforms like Shopify and WooCommerce provide a suite of services to businesses of all sizes. Due to their prevalence, understanding the fundamental architecture of these platforms will benefit you as a full-stack web developer.

This application is the back end for an e-commerce, and this app utilizes the Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

## 4. Installation:
Please make sure to have following programs installed on your computer to use this app:
+ VS Code
+ GitBash
+ Node.js
+ MySQL

To use this program, `git clone` the repo down to your local. Then, run `npm install` in order to install the `npm` package dependencies as specified in the `./package.json` - `Express.js`, `mysql2`, `sequelize`, and `dotenv` will be installed. Now, you are ready to go!

## 5. Usage:
To use this application, follow the instruction below: 
+ First, run `npm install` on your terminal, then it will install the required `npm` packages.
+ Second, let's create the database - `ecommerce_db`:
  + `mysql -u root -p`: login to `MySQL` then type the following commends:
  + `source ./db/schema.sql;`: this will create `ecommerce_db`
  + `show databases;`: Now, you will see `ecommerce_db` in the `Database` list
  + `use ecommerce_db;`: it is empty now.
  + `show tables`: there is no tables yet.
  + `exit`: exit the mysql terminal
+ Third, let's include tables in the database we just created, `ecommerce_db`:
  + `node ./seeds/index.js` or `npm run seed`: these will insert the following tables in the `ecommerce_db`:
    + `category`
    + `product`
    + `product_tag`
    + `tag`
  + After seeding, the `ecommerce_db` will have something like in `./ecommerce_db.txt` - this will give you the starting information when using this application.
+ Now, let's run the program:
  + Set an Environmental Variable in `./.env` file:
    + `touch .env`: this will create `./.env` file
    + Now, add the following three lines in `./.env`
      + DB_NAME="ecommerce_db"
      + DB_USER="root"
      + DB_PASSWORD="your_mysql_password"
  + Then, run the program with one of the following approaches:
    + `node server.js` or `npm run start`: these will start `node` program in normal way. 
    + `nodemon server.js` or `npm run watch`: these will start `node` program with `nodemon`, which monitors the project directory and automatically restarts your node application when it detects any changes.
  + Now, check the results with `Insomnia`, a collaborative open source API development platform - https://insomnia.rest/.
